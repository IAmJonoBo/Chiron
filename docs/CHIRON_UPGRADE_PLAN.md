# Chiron Upgrade Plan

This document outlines the upgrade path and evolution plan for Chiron.

## Overview

Chiron follows a frontier-grade approach to continuous improvement, with clear milestones and upgrade paths.

## Version Strategy

### Semantic Versioning

Chiron uses semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes to public API
- **MINOR**: New features, backwards compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backwards compatible

### Current Version

See the latest version in:

- `pyproject.toml` - Source of truth
- `src/chiron/__init__.py` - Python version string
- GitHub releases - Tagged releases

## Upgrade Paths

### From Pre-1.0 to 1.0

The 1.0 release will stabilize the public API. Changes before 1.0:

- Minor version bumps may include breaking changes
- Follow changelog for migration guides
- Use deprecation warnings as upgrade signals

### Minor Version Upgrades

Minor version upgrades are backwards compatible:

1. Review changelog for new features
2. Update dependencies: `uv sync`
3. Run tests: `uv run pytest`
4. Update configuration if using new features

### Major Version Upgrades

Major version upgrades may include breaking changes:

1. Review migration guide in release notes
2. Check deprecation warnings in current version
3. Update code to use new APIs
4. Run full test suite
5. Update CI/CD configurations if needed

## Deprecation Policy

### Deprecation Timeline

1. **Announcement**: Feature marked as deprecated in docs and code
2. **Warning Period**: 2 minor versions with deprecation warnings
3. **Removal**: Removed in next major version

### Example

```python
# Version 0.5.0: Feature introduced
def old_feature():
    pass

# Version 0.8.0: Feature deprecated
def old_feature():
    warnings.warn("old_feature is deprecated, use new_feature instead",
                  DeprecationWarning)

# Version 0.10.0: Still available with warnings

# Version 1.0.0: Feature removed, use new_feature
```
