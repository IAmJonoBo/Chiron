# Testing & Quality Summary (April 2025)

## Current Status

- Full test run: `python3 -m pytest tests/`
  - **Outcome**: `254 passed`, `0 failed`, `1 skipped`
  - **Runtime**: ~6s on Linux x86_64
  - **Coverage**: `55.45%` (threshold `50%`), **passing quality gate with +5.45% margin** ✅
  - Coverage concentrated on: core (100%), observability (96-100%), telemetry (98%), schema_validator (97%), API routes (77%), reproducibility (87%)
- Contract tests (`tests/test_contracts.py`) still rely on Pact's Ruby service; they emit 130+ pending deprecation warnings and remain effectively stubbed despite now running end-to-end with timeouts.
- Test noise: Pact's pending-deprecation warnings dominate output; OTLP exporter noise eliminated by test isolation and mocking.

## Failing Suites

None — all tests passing. Quality gate exceeded by 5.45%.

## Coverage Highlights

- **Core modules fully tested**: `chiron.core` (100%), `chiron.api` (100%), `chiron.telemetry` (98%), `chiron.tuf_metadata` (98%)
- **Observability complete**: `chiron.observability.*` now at 96-100% coverage (was 0%):
  - `logging.py`: 100%
  - `metrics.py`: 96%
  - `tracing.py`: 96%
- **CLI partially tested**: `chiron.cli.main` at 30% (was 0%), helpers and error paths covered
- **Schema validation**: `schema_validator.py` at 97% (was 43%)
- **Service routes**: `api.py` at 77%, `app.py` at 65%, `health.py` at 48%
- **Supply-chain modules remain omitted**: `chiron.deps/*` explicitly excluded from coverage, leaving ~1,000 statements unexecuted
- Pact interactions execute but stay synthetic; contract coverage continues to lack integration with real HTTP clients.

## Required Actions

1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Extend coverage to observability subsystems — now at 96-100% coverage
2. Replace Pact's Ruby mock with an HTTP fixture or ephemeral port orchestration so contract tests deliver meaningful assertions without 130+ warnings.
3. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Harden telemetry defaults to keep exporters quiet in CI — achieved through test isolation and proper mocking
4. **Next Priority**: Add coverage to `chiron.deps/*` modules (constraints, policy, bundler, signing, supply_chain) to exercise remediation paths and enable tightening threshold to 60%+

## Required Actions

1. Extend coverage to the currently omitted subsystems (`chiron.deps/*`, orchestration flows, CLI) so we can tighten the threshold again and exercise remediation paths.
2. Replace Pact's Ruby mock with an HTTP fixture or ephemeral port orchestration so contract tests deliver meaningful assertions without 130+ warnings.
3. Continue hardening telemetry defaults to keep exporters quiet in CI and align docs with the new behaviour.

## Suggested Test Plan (Next Iteration)

- **Unit**: ✅ Coverage added for CLI helpers, schema_validator, and observability modules. **Next**: Add coverage for supply-chain modules (`deps/*`) to enable stricter gate (60%+).
- **Integration**: Expand FastAPI tests to cover error paths and policy/verification flows without shelling out. Add timeout handling and proper mocking.
- **Contract**: Hook Pact interactions to a real client (or provide an HTTP fixture) so they deliver actionable value without 130+ deprecation warnings.
- **Regression**: ✅ Telemetry/exporter toggles now deterministic and properly isolated in tests.
