# Tooling Implementation Status

This document tracks the implementation status of advanced tooling opportunities identified in the project roadmap.

## Executive Summary

This assessment reviews the tooling opportunities outlined in the original roadmap and documents their current implementation status. The findings show that many of the "immediate wins" have been implemented, while several "near-term" and "strategic" items remain as future enhancements.

## Immediate Wins (Target: Next Sprint)

### ✅ Conftest + OPA Bundle
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED

**Evidence**:
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` includes OPA policy check hook (lines 127-132)
- `scripts/run_policy_checks.sh` executes policy enforcement
- `scripts/build_opa_bundle.sh` creates reusable OPA bundles
- `.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml` includes policy-gate job
- `Makefile` includes `policy-check` and `policy-bundle` targets

**Purpose**: Enforce dependency and workflow policies (SBOM freshness, required signing steps) directly in CI and pre-commit.

### ✅ pytest-xdist
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED

**Evidence**:
- `pyproject.toml` includes pytest-xdist in required_plugins
- Test configuration uses `-n=auto` and `--dist=worksteal` for parallel execution
- Significantly speeds up the 3x OS matrix in CI

**Purpose**: Speed up test execution with parallel test running.

### ✅ pytest-randomly
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED (with minor config issue)

**Evidence**:
- `pyproject.toml` includes pytest-randomly in dependencies
- Tests run with randomized order to surface order-dependent flakes
- Note: Config option `randomly_dont_reorganize` had syntax issue (fixed)

**Purpose**: Surface order-dependent test flake risks.

### ✅ Deptry
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED

**Evidence**:
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` includes deptry hook (lines 29-33)
- `Makefile` includes `deptry` target for manual runs
- Configured with `pyproject.toml` settings

**Purpose**: Catch unused/undeclared dependencies automatically in quality gates (complements `sync_env_deps.py`).

### ✅ Vale for Docs Linting
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED

**Evidence**:
- `.vale.ini` configuration file created
- `.vale/styles/config/vocabularies/Chiron/accept.txt` with project-specific terms
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` includes Vale hook for markdown files
- `.github/workflows/docs-lint.yml` runs Vale linting on documentation
- `Makefile` can be extended with `docs-lint` target

**Purpose**: Enforce documentation style consistency and quality across the project.

## Near-term Upgrades (Target: 1–2 Quarters)

### ✅ Mutation Testing (mutmut or cosmic-ray)
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED

**Evidence**:
- `mutmut>=3.4.0` added to dev dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- `[tool.mutmut]` configuration section added to `pyproject.toml`
- `Makefile` includes `mutmut-run`, `mutmut-results`, and `mutmut-html` targets
- Configured to mutate `src/chiron/` and run tests from `tests/`

**Purpose**: Validate test suite quality by introducing code mutations and ensuring tests catch them.

### ✅ Coverage-on-diff Gate (diff-cover)
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED

**Evidence**:
- `diff-cover>=10.0.0` added to dev dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- `.github/workflows/diff-cover.yml` workflow runs on pull requests
- `Makefile` includes `diff-cover` target for local testing
- Configured with 80% threshold for changed lines
- Workflow comments PR with coverage results

**Purpose**: Accelerate coverage improvement by requiring high coverage on new/changed code without blocking work on existing code.

### ✅ CodeQL Workflow
**Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**Evidence**:
- `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` dedicated CodeQL analysis workflow
- Runs on push, pull request, and weekly schedule
- Uses `security-extended` and `security-and-quality` queries
- Uploads results to GitHub Security tab
- Integrates with existing CI caching

**Purpose**: Layer GitHub's SAST on top of Bandit/Semgrep for defense-in-depth security analysis.

### ✅ Trivy Container Scanning
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED

**Evidence**:
- `.github/workflows/trivy.yml` comprehensive Trivy scanning workflow
- Scans both filesystem and container images
- Runs on push, pull request, and weekly schedule
- Uploads SARIF results to GitHub Security tab
- Generates detailed JSON reports
- Fails on critical/high vulnerabilities
- Separate jobs for repo and container scanning

**Purpose**: Extend SBOM coverage to base images and validate container security.

### ✅ Sigstore Policy-controller / Cosign Verify-step
**Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**Evidence**:
- Cosign signing is implemented in `.github/workflows/wheels.yml`
- `.github/workflows/sigstore-verify.yml` automated verification workflow
- Verifies signatures using Cosign with certificate identity checks
- Validates SLSA provenance structure
- Runs after successful wheel/release builds
- CLI includes `--verify-provenance` flag
- Generates verification reports

**Purpose**: Automate attestation verification in CI before release uploads.

## Strategic / Frontier Experiments

### ✅ Reprotest + Diffoscope Harness
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED

**Evidence**:
- `.github/workflows/reproducibility.yml` comprehensive reproducibility validation
- Uses reprotest with multiple build variations
- Uses diffoscope to compare builds byte-by-byte
- Generates HTML and text reports of differences
- Comments on PRs with reproducibility results
- Runs on push, pull request, and weekly schedule
- Creates reproducibility badge data

**Purpose**: Continuously validate the "reproducible wheels" claim with actual rebuild diffs.

### ✅ In-toto/SLSA Provenance Generator
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED

**Evidence**:
- `.github/workflows/wheels.yml` includes SLSA provenance generation
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` has dedicated SLSA provenance job
- `src/chiron/deps/oci_packaging.py` includes provenance media type
- `src/chiron/cli/main.py` now simply re-exports the Typer CLI (`chiron.typer_cli`)
- Feature flag exists for SLSA provenance requirement

**Purpose**: Emit v1.0 attestation artifacts for every build, aligning with SLSA L3+ expectations.

### ✅ LLM-powered Contract Tests
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED

**Evidence**:
- `src/chiron/mcp/llm_contracts.py` introduces deterministic LLM clients and a contract runner
- `tests/test_mcp_llm_contracts.py` exercises default scenarios against the MCP server
- `run_default_contracts()` integrates with CI-friendly deterministic responses

**Purpose**: Validate MCP tool contracts via natural-language prompts, ensuring tool metadata and responses remain consistent as new capabilities ship.

### ✅ Observability Sandbox (Docker Compose)
**Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**Evidence**:
- `docker-compose.observability.yml` complete observability stack
- Includes OpenTelemetry Collector, Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana, Tempo, and Loki
- `otel-collector-config.yaml` comprehensive collector configuration
- `prometheus.yml` metrics scraping configuration
- `tempo.yaml` traces backend configuration
- `docs/OBSERVABILITY_SANDBOX.md` detailed usage guide
- Chiron service integrated with automatic instrumentation
- All services networked and properly configured

**Purpose**: Enable local visualization of traces/metrics for development and testing.

### ✅ Chaos & Load Automation (k6/Locust + Chaostoolkit)
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED

**Evidence**:
- `chaos/` directory with complete Chaos Toolkit setup
- `chaos/experiments/service-availability.json` availability experiment
- `chaos/actions.py` custom chaos actions (HTTP load generation)
- `chaos/probes.py` custom probes (response time, health checks)
- `chaos/controls.py` experiment lifecycle hooks
- `chaos/README.md` comprehensive documentation
- Integration with observability sandbox for monitoring

**Purpose**: Rehearse failure scenarios for FastAPI routes and dependency workflows before enterprise adoption.
