# Chiron Project Instructions

Chiron is a frontier-grade, production-ready Python library and service focused on:

- Modern packaging with pyproject.toml (PEP 621/517)
- Security-first approach with SBOM generation, Sigstore signing, and vulnerability scanning
- Service mode with FastAPI and OpenAPI documentation
- Observability with OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- Supply chain security with SLSA provenance
- Developer experience with uv, pre-commit, and dev containers

## Development Guidelines

- Use `uv` for dependency management and tool execution
- Follow conventional commits for automated versioning
- Maintain security posture with regular SBOM and vulnerability scans
- Ensure all code follows the established patterns for observability
- Use OpenFeature for feature flags and policy-as-code with OPA/Conftest
