            This PR was automatically generated to sync dependency installation commands 
            between the devcontainer configuration and GitHub Actions workflows.
            
            Changes ensure that:
            - `.devcontainer/post-create.sh` uses the same `uv sync` command as CI
            - All GitHub Actions workflows use consistent dependency installation
            
            Please review and merge if changes look correct.
