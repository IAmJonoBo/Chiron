## Risks / Notes
- Remaining gaps now centre on live Pact validation against deployed services; the new `--contracts` gate exercises the local mock-service flow but production rollouts should still trial full telemetry pipelines before release.
- Pact-related warnings remain noisy but accepted for now; dynamic port allocation reduces flake risk but HTTP-level validation is still outstanding.
- Pact contract tests now auto-skip when the mock service cannot start; run `pact-mock-service` locally to exercise full interactions before release sign-off.
- New QA toolbox accelerates iteration but coverage hotspots highlighted (deps.verify, service routes) still require targeted tests.
- Bandit informational findings (3 medium, 81 low) stem from packaging/semgrep helpers and will be triaged with security owners.
- Diataxis overview depends on `docs/diataxis.json`; keep the mapping updated when adding or renaming guides to avoid stale navigation.
- Coverage sits at 83.67% after the enhanced refactor heuristics; continue targeting high-branch modules to regain margin.
- Refactor heuristics flag hotspots automatically; future passes should feed live complexity metrics into roadmap prioritisation.
