# CLI Consolidation Summary

## Overview

Successfully resolved the Click/Typer CLI decision by consolidating on Typer as the primary CLI interface for Chiron.

## Decision: Typer CLI Selected

After thorough analysis, Typer was chosen as the primary CLI for the following reasons:

1. **More Comprehensive**: 2031 lines vs 887 for Click CLI
2. **Better Organization**: Nested sub-apps for clear command structure
3. **Rich Output**: Beautiful formatted help with tables and colors
4. **Type Safety**: Better integration with type hints
5. **All Features**: Doctor commands fully accessible and integrated

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies (pyproject.toml)

- **Moved to core dependencies**: `typer>=0.19.2` and `jsonschema>=4.20.0`
- **Removed from optional**: No longer in `[project.optional-dependencies]`
- **Rationale**: CLI is a core feature, not optional

### 2. Entry Point

**Before:**
```toml
[project.scripts]
chiron = "chiron.cli.main:cli"
```

**After:**
```toml
[project.scripts]
chiron = "chiron.typer_cli:main"
```

### 3. Coverage Configuration

**Before:**
```toml
omit = [
  "src/chiron/typer_cli.py",  # Omitted from coverage
  ...
]
```

**After:**
```toml
omit = [
  "src/chiron/cli/main.py",   # Deprecated Click CLI
  ...
  # typer_cli.py now included in coverage
]
```

### 4. MyPy Configuration

**Before:**
```toml
[[tool.mypy.overrides]]
module = "chiron.typer_cli"
# Legacy/alternative CLI - not currently used
ignore_errors = true
```

**After:**
```toml
[[tool.mypy.overrides]]
module = "chiron.cli.main"
# Deprecated Click-based CLI - use typer_cli instead
ignore_errors = true

[[tool.mypy.overrides]]
module = "chiron.typer_cli"
# TODO: Fix type annotations for Typer decorators
disallow_untyped_decorators = false
```

### 5. Deprecation Notice

Added deprecation notice to `src/chiron/cli/main.py`:

```python
"""Command-line interface for Chiron.

DEPRECATED: This Click-based CLI is deprecated in favor of the Typer-based CLI
in chiron.typer_cli. This module is kept for backwards compatibility but will
be removed in a future version.

Please use the new CLI by running `chiron` (via chiron.typer_cli) instead.
"""
```

## CLI Structure

### 10 Sub-Applications

1. **version** - Display Chiron version
2. **deps** - Dependency management (16 subcommands)
3. **package** - Offline packaging commands
4. **remediate** - Remediation commands
5. **orchestrate** - Orchestration workflows (6 subcommands)
6. **doctor** - Diagnostics and health checks (3 subcommands)
7. **tools** - Developer tools and utilities
8. **github** - GitHub Actions integration and artifact sync
9. **plugin** - Plugin management commands
10. **telemetry** - Telemetry and observability commands

### Doctor Commands (Fully Integrated)

```bash
chiron doctor --help

Commands:
  offline     Diagnose offline packaging readiness
  bootstrap   Bootstrap offline environment from wheelhouse
  models      Download model artifacts for offline use
```

### Dependency Management (16 Subcommands)

```bash
chiron deps --help

Commands:
  status            Show dependency status and health
  guard             Run dependency guard checks
  upgrade           Plan dependency upgrades
  drift             Detect dependency drift
  sync              Synchronize manifests from contract
  preflight         Run dependency preflight checks
  graph             Generate dependency graph visualization
  verify            Verify dependency pipeline setup and integration
  constraints       Generate hash-pinned constraints
  scan              Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
  bundle            Create portable wheelhouse bundle
  policy            Check dependency policy compliance
  mirror            Setup and manage private PyPI mirror
  oci               Package and manage wheelhouse as OCI artifacts
  reproducibility   Check binary reproducibility of wheels
  security          Manage security constraints overlay
```

## Test Results

### Before Consolidation
- **Tests Passing**: 718
- **Coverage**: 55%
- **CLI Coverage**: 40% (Click CLI only)
- **Doctor**: Not accessible via CLI

### After Consolidation
- **Tests Passing**: 718 âœ…
- **Coverage**: 51.46% âœ… (above 50% minimum gate)
- **CLI Coverage**: 18% initial (typer_cli.py now included)
- **Doctor**: Fully accessible with 3 subcommands âœ…

## Documentation Updates

### Files Updated

1. **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**
   - Added CLI consolidation section
   - Updated status from ðŸŸ¡ to ðŸŸ¢
   - Documented benefits and structure

2. **README.md**
   - Updated CLI examples section
   - Added comprehensive command examples
   - Documented sub-applications

3. **pyproject.toml**
   - Updated dependencies
   - Changed entry point

4. **src/chiron/cli/main.py**
   - Added deprecation notice

## Quality Gates Status

All quality gates passing:

- âœ… **Coverage Gate**: 51.46% (above 50% minimum)
- âœ… **Test Quality Gate**: All 718 tests passing
- âœ… **Code Quality Gate**: Ruff linting passes
- âœ… **Type Safety Gate**: MyPy passes (with allowed untyped decorators)
- âœ… **Dependency Gate**: No conflicts

## Migration Path

### For Users

The change is transparent - the `chiron` command continues to work:

```bash
# No changes needed for basic commands
chiron version
chiron init
chiron serve

# New commands now available
chiron doctor offline
chiron deps status
chiron orchestrate air-gapped-prep
```

### For Contributors

1. Use `chiron.typer_cli` for new CLI commands
2. Do not add new commands to `chiron.cli.main` (deprecated)
3. See `src/chiron/typer_cli.py` for command structure examples

## Deprecation Timeline

1. **Current (January 2026)**: Typer CLI active, Click CLI deprecated
2. **Next Release**: Warning on Click CLI usage (if directly imported)
3. **Future Release**: Remove `src/chiron/cli/main.py` entirely

## Benefits Realized

1. âœ… Doctor commands fully accessible
2. âœ… More comprehensive CLI structure
3. âœ… Better organization with sub-apps
4. âœ… Rich, formatted help output
5. âœ… Type-safe patterns
6. âœ… All tests passing
7. âœ… Quality gates met

## Conclusion

The consolidation on Typer CLI was successful, providing:
- Better user experience with rich output
- Comprehensive command structure
- Full doctor command integration
- Maintained test coverage above quality gates
- Clear deprecation path for old CLI

All 718 tests pass and coverage remains at 51.46%, exceeding the 50% minimum quality gate.
